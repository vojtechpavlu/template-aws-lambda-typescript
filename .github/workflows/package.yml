  This workflow builds the package, uploads it to S3 bucket and creates a git tag.
  It is triggered on pushes to the main branch.

  # This workflow is meant to be executed on each push to the main branch - i.e. when you decide the feature is finished, (dev-)tested 
  # and you think ready to be packaged and released to a somewhat live environment (like test or something similar).
  #
  # To make it so, comment the `workflow_dispatch` and uncomment the `push` section below.
